        <h3>You deserve healing</h3>
        <h5>
        I became a therapist because I saw firsthand how miraculous 
        therapy can be and decided to help others find long lasting 
        happiness. I believe the mind and body are designed to heal 
        themselves. Our healing only stops when something stands in 
        its way. This is why I specialize in Trauma and use a combination 
        of EMDR and mindfulness and somatic based approaches.
